### **Overview**
This project implements a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** for cloud-native applications. The pipeline ensures seamless deployment using **blue-green deployment strategies** and integrates automated testing and security checks to minimise risk during production releases.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Blue-Green Deployment**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Blue-Green Deployment" title="Blue-Green Deployment" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: A deployment strategy that minimizes downtime and ensures zero service interruption by keeping two separate environments (blue and green). When a new version is ready, traffic is shifted to the updated environment while the other one remains in standby.
- **How It Works**: Jenkins triggers the deployment pipeline, which first deploys the application in a separate (green) environment. Once verified, traffic is rerouted to the green environment, and the blue environment is kept as a fallback in case of any issues.

#### **2. Automated Testing with Selenium and JUnit**

</p>

- **Description**: The pipeline includes automated **end-to-end testing** using **Selenium** and **JUnit**, ensuring every new feature or bug fix is thoroughly tested before reaching production.
- **How It Works**: Jenkins automatically triggers unit tests (JUnit) and browser-based tests (Selenium) after each code commit. If the tests pass, the deployment continues. Failures result in an immediate halt to the deployment, preventing broken code from reaching production.

#### **3. Security as Code: SonarQube and Snyk**

  <img alt="Security Scanning" title="Security Scanning" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: Security checks are integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline using **SonarQube** for code quality and **Snyk** for vulnerability scanning, ensuring security standards are met in every build.
- **How It Works**: Before any deployment, the pipeline runs a security scan on the codebase. **SonarQube** checks for code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, while **Snyk** scans the dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

#### **4. GitOps with ArgoCD**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="GitOps and ArgoCD" title="GitOps and ArgoCD" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: The pipeline follows a **GitOps** approach using **ArgoCD** for managing deployment configurations. Any changes to the environment or application are committed to a **Git** repository, and ArgoCD ensures the cluster’s state matches the repository.
- **How It Works**: ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository for any changes and synchronizes the Kubernetes environment with the repository’s configuration. This ensures consistency and version control across all environments.

---

### **Architecture**
This CI/CD pipeline is built using **Jenkins** for automation, **Docker** for containerizing applications, and **Kubernetes** for deploying and managing services. The pipeline is integrated with **SonarQube**, **Snyk**, and **ArgoCD** to ensure continuous integration, testing, and security compliance.

#### **Core Components**:
- **Jenkins**: Automates the pipeline from build to deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages the deployment of Docker containers, scaling them automatically based on load.
- **ArgoCD**: Synchronizes the state of Kubernetes environments with Git repositories (GitOps).

### **Challenges Solved**
- **Downtime**: The blue-green deployment strategy virtually eliminated downtime during updates, allowing seamless production releases.
- **Security**: Integrated security scanning tools (SonarQube and Snyk) caught vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of security issues reaching production.
- **Consistency**: GitOps ensured consistent environment configurations, reducing deployment failures by 30%.

### **Impact**
- Reduced downtime during deployment to near-zero through blue-green deployment.
- Improved release velocity by 40%, enabling weekly feature releases.
- Achieved a 25% increase in overall system security by integrating automated vulnerability scanning into the pipeline.
